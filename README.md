# Hi there 👋



I've been tinkering with JavaScript, HTML and CSS  recently, and have really enjoyed learning more about the web along the way. Welcome to my profile!

🤖 AI Development: In the final year of my degree, as part of a team of 4 I worked on a MultiModal Artificial Intelligence model that predicts the type of pneumonia a patient has based on 3 input modalities:
1. Image data in the form of XRays taken of a patient's lungs
2. Time-Series and
3. Static data.
- We were granted access to the [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/) dataset for the project.
- Unfortunately, the code for that project is in a private repo on my university [github account](https://github.com/Gizs).

🔧 Skills: Some of the tools and technologies I work with include:

🔭 I’m currently working on: portfolio.fit. A SAAS page builder for professionals that want to display their work online but don't want to go through the hassle of making and hosting a personal website.
The user chooses a template and their portfolio is hosted under a personal http link.

🌱 I’m currently learning: More about modern frontend frameworks and tooling such as Angular, React and TypeScript.
