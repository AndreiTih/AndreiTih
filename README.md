# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been tinkering with C/C++ recently, and have really enjoyed learning more about computers along the way. Welcome to my profile!
<br>
<br>
ðŸ’» **C++ Development:** . You can explore some of my C++ projects [here](https://andreitihoan.com/projects).
<br>
<br>
ðŸ¤– **AI Development:** In the final year of my degree, as part of a team of 4 I worked on a MultiModal Artificial Intelligence model that predicts the type of pneumonia a patient has based on 3 input modalities:
1. Image data in the form of XRays taken of a patient's lungs
2. Time-Series and
3. Static data.

We were granted access to the [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/) dataset for the project.
Unfortounately, the code for that project is in a private repo on my university [github account](https://github.com/Gizs).

ðŸ”§ **Skills:** Some of the tools and technologies I work with include:

</p>

ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on:** A real-time tracer. That is, a program that can display the callback trace of any individual thread of a process in real-time while the process is running.

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning:** More about C/C++ and practicing my math skills.
